Bézier CURVES AND SURFACES
This spline approximation method was developed by the French engineer Pierre Bézier for use in the design of Renault automobile bodies. Bézier splines have a number of properties that make them highly useful and convenient for curve and surface design. They are also easy to implement. For these reasons, Bézier splines are widely available in various CAD systems, in general graphics packages (such as GL on Silicon Graphics systems), and in assorted drawing and painting packages (such as Aldus SuperPaint and Cricket Draw).
